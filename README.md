# SECURE-ONLINE-BANKING-SYSTEM
The Application is based on Modern Banking how the day to day the transactions are done with bank admins called manager cashier and user, For this I used Technologies HTML JS CSS as a Frontend, JSP Java as backend code development and Oracle SQL as database In this project there are four Main modules
The Online Banking System the application is based on the banking system with the Admin/Manager/Cashier and User modules the Admin can controll all the records and information and transaction's done using the bank and
all the transactions done through bank account will trackable by bank admins and user in a transaction Enquiry
1. Bank Manager Can log in to the web site and audit the bank accounts
2. Bank Cashier can handle the withdrawal deposit and user related transaction enquiry details, Creating new account fund transfer etc
3. Bank User can login to the application and check the bank balance and transfer the fund from user bank account to another user account with a Realtime transaction system and here I restricted the transaction when user don't have enough fund to transfer at the end of transaction user can re verify the bank transaction using as transaction history on the same user portal just like an UPI 
4. Bank User register/Sign up for this I developed like an API that controls the Bank cashier with a new account register accept page
